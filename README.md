# Tensor-Lite

Tensor-Lite is a simple library for building and training machine learning models. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for building computational graphs and performing gradient-based optimization. It uses only native Python, without any dependencies on third-party libraries, making it easy to use and understand. Tensor-Lite was inspired by [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and is similar to libraries like [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) and [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

> **NOTE**
> Please note that Tensor-Lite is a hobby project and was created as an enjoyable learning exercise. It should not be used in production environments. For production machine learning projects, it is recommended to use a more robust and widely-used library such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Features

- Pure native Python without any dependencies.

- Gradient ascent and descent optimization methods included.

## Example usage

Here is a simple example that demonstrates how to use Tensor-Lite to optimize a linear regression model:

```python
```

## Example directory

The [example directory](./examples) contains a number of examples that demonstrate how to use Tensor-Lite to solve various machine learning problems, including linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.
